        "Climate change has led to a rapid increase in the occurrence of extreme weather events globally, including floods, droughts, and wildfires. In the longer term, some regions will experience aridification while others will risk sinking due to rising sea levels. Typically, such predictions are done via weather and climate models that simulate the physical interactions between the atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface processes that operate at different scales. Due to the inherent complexity, these climate models can be inaccurate or computationally expensive to run, especially for detecting climate extremes at high spatiotemporal resolutions. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce the participants to machine learning approaches for addressing two fundamental challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) **Temporal Forecasting**: The goal is to predict climate variables into the future. \\\n",
        "(2) **Spatial Downscaling**: The goal is to learn a mapping that transforms low-resolution outputs of climate models into high-resolution regional forecasts. \n",
        "\n",
        "We illustrate the two key challenges in predicting temperature, a key indicator of global warming levels around the world, in the figure below. Given a temperature grid at a particular resolution **R** at a time stamp **T**, temporal forecasting focuses on predicting the temperature at a future time stamp **T+H** where **H** is the prediction horizon whereas the climate downscaling focuses on predicting the temperature at the same timestep T but at a higher resolution **(R' > R)**.

        "1. Our package with this tutorial makes it easy for the practitioners to focus on the machine learning model design and evaluate their models against standard benchmarks such as Weatherbench ([Leaderboard](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench)) using our evaluation support. \n",
        "2. The climate experts can load and train their customized machine learning models with various hyperparameters. For instance, they can study the effect of varying the capacity of machine learning models on its predictions.\n",
        "3. To best of our knowledge, this is the only package that provides support for temporal forecasting and spatial downscaling under the hood. It helps the forecasting community to benefit from the improvements in modeling downscaling and vice-versa."

        "1. Due to the noise involved in capturing climate variables, climate modeling is particularly a challenging task. Different datasets such as ERA5, CMIP6 may contain different values for a particular climate variable. \n",
        "2. This tutorial does not cover the aspect of uncertainity in the model predictions. We shall add more capabilities to our models in the package for climate modelers to quantify the error in the predicted output.\n",
        "3. There is a massive amount of climate data available (~10 TBs), our tutorial does not cover aspects of how to deal with the data at that scale which might be important for capturing more sophisticated climate phenomenon."
