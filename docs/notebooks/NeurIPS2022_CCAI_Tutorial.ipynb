    "Climate change has led to a rapid increase in the occurrence of extreme weather events globally, including floods, droughts, and wildfires. In the longer term, some regions will experience aridification while others will risk sinking due to rising sea levels. Typically, such predictions are done via weather and climate models that simulate the physical interactions between the atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface processes that operate at different scales. Due to the inherent complexity, these climate models can be inaccurate or computationally expensive to run, especially for detecting climate extremes at high spatiotemporal resolutions. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce the participants to machine learning approaches for addressing two fundamental challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) **Temporal Forecasting**: The goal is to predict climate variables into the future. \\\n",
    "(2) **Spatial Downscaling**: The goal is to learn a mapping that transforms low-resolution outputs of climate models into high-resolution regional forecasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate the two key challenges in predicting temperature, a key indicator of global warming levels around the world, in the figure below. Given a temperature grid at a particular resolution **R** at a time stamp **T**, temporal forecasting focuses on predicting the temperature at a future time stamp **T+H** where **H** is the prediction horizon whereas the climate downscaling focuses on predicting the temperature at the same timestep T but at a higher resolution **(R' > R)**.

    "In practice, statistical spatial downscaling can be used to make predictions about a climate variable (a) over the latitude-longitude grid of **higher** resolution than the input grid and (b) on specific sites at the target locations. For example, we can predict the temperature at a specific station in Germany based on the gridded temperature data over the whole country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major class of statistical downscaling models include Perfect Prognosis (PP) [1] that aims at learning a transfer function $$\\hat{y} = f(x, Z)$$ where $y$ is the true value at location $x$ and $Z$ are the set of model predictors for the climate model. The various PP models differ in their realization of the transfer function $f$. Related works in [2] provides deeper details into the previous works. In [2,3], the authors use CNNs as the transfer function, broadly due to its inherent inductive bias towards handling Vision data. The ability of Deep CNNs to perform super-resolution is a well-explored field of study [4].\n",
