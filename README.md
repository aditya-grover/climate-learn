**ClimateLearn** is a Python library for accessing state-of-the-art climate data and machine learning models in a standardized, straightforward way. This library provides access to multiple datasets, a zoo of baseline approaches, and a suite of metrics and visualizations for large-scale benchmarking of statistical downscaling and temporal forecasting methods. 

## Getting Started

### Quickstart
Please refer to this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WiNEK1BHsiGzo_bT9Fcm8lea2H_ghNfa).

For additional information, some key features of ClimateLearn were previewed at a spotlight tutorial in the "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning" Workshop at the Neural Information Processing Systems 2022 Conference. The slides and recorded talk can be found here: https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/114.
